i'll got a string as 

42.0fabc

So, the first thing is to see if there is base cenarios like

char:
only a character and 1 lenght

int:
Is not a char and there is not '.' in it.

Float:
Is not a char and there is a '.' and something after '.' and finalize with 'f'

Double:
is like a float, but there is not a 'f'

So, you can do a if else sentences to filter each case...

After that, you need to see if the input (char, int, float or double)
	is on its limits (char_limits, int_limits, float_limits or double_limits)
	if the input is char, but falls outter of limits my programn must raise a error called impossible....

Finally there are some words as -inff, +inff and nanf...
and i dont know yet how it behaves... 

And i dont know too why '0' raise a text called Non displayable...
And i dont know too if others values raise the same text...
